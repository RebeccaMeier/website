I’m a professional Graphic Designer working since 2011 in the french-speaking part of Switzerland. Please feel free to take a look at my work which, I think, conveys my creative process much better than any number of words. If you appreciate it and would like to work with me or simply need further information, don’t hesitate to get in touch with me.
