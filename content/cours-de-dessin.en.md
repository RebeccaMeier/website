For those interested in drawing and its theory, I give lessons for any level.
I believe every one has the capabilities to learn how to draw. A private lesson with a graphic designer will allow you to discover the basis and more if you like!
The cursus will take the form that most suits you : every week, twice Ã  month or only a few lessons according to your wishes and your goals.
52.- CHF per hour.
