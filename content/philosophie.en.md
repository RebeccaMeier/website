I am passionate about life and eager for knowledge. I like trying to solve the unsolvable, understand complex mechanisms, manipulate, adjust and create things. I often wondered if I would ever be able to find a profession combining both my imaginative nature and my eagerness to learn. The choice wasnâ€™t easy but turning what was once my hobby into my job happened to be a good bet. One day I suddenly moved to Belgium to study and explore the realm of visual communication. It turned out to be the perfect choice for me. I never imagined how useful my inquiring personality would be in the world of Graphic Design. Every day brings its enigmas and its answers. Welcome to my world. Rebecca Meier
