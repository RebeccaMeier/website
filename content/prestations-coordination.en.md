I offer my customers services ahead of the graphic design stage, regarding the coordination of projects with a communication need or projects leading to a publication (cultural events, inaugurations, directories, etc.).

I was, for example, able to organize the creation of two editions of a directory, where I collected data (from the creation of the form, to the follow-up of e-mails, coordination with a webmaster and the committee, etc.) managed requests for support (fund application file, budget, relationship with sponsors) and then did the layout and production follow-up.
And also help set up cultural events such as the FÃªte de la Danse or the Nuit du Cirque, or private events such as the inaugural week-end of Muzoo in La Chaux-de-Fonds (budget, presentation files, requests for authorization, on-site organization, coordination between parties, staff management, etc.), with the added bonus of communication and layout of the various media.

This proposal optimizes the delicate moment for any event: the time between the decision making and the ability to make it graphically distributable in time!
Assignments that often require several people, can be carried out by me, thanks to my dual role, which saves time and money to my clients.
