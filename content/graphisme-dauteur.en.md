# “monde sensible”

Graphic experimentation about sightloss.

We all have in common the fact of seeing and most of us also seem not to really look.
Being irrationally sure that I would end up blind, I picked up the habit of looking more intently and enjoying every flash of light. I would like to share the importance of sight, through the experience of loosing it.

This project takes shape as a handmade book soon to be available in 20 original copies.

Its purpose is to explore different stages of sightloss and make anyone enjoy the simple fact of seeing.
