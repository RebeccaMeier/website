In order to work together efficiently meetings are the best way to do it. It allows us to get to know each other and makes the communication process easier. It also helps me understand your needs and wishes.
Once I heard what you want, I can look around on the existing market what is done and research which concepts stick the best with what you do.
Then I explore the graphic possibilities and get some ideas on paper. These ideas will be shown to you and will be the root of where to go next. We will talk about the possible out comings and will decide together in which direction to go.

From there, I create the final job and can help you with the publication process, printing or online.
